## Known Limitations

1. **IE 11 Support**: Limited due to Tailwind 4 features

   - Solution: Use fallback fonts and colors
   - Recommendation: Upgrade browser to Edge

2. **Very Old Android Browsers**: Some CSS features may not work

   - Solution: Progressive enhancement approach
   - Recommendation: Direct users to latest browser

3. **Slow Connections**: Large CSS file may delay initial load
   - Solution: Already minified by Next.js
   - Recommendation: Monitor Core Web Vitals
